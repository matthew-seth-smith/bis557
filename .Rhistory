#Author: Denise Esserman
#Creation Date: November 24, 2015 (version 3.2.2)
#Modified: November 06, 2017 (version 3.4.2)
#Purpose: This function calculates the coverage probabilities for a one sample proportion using
#         three methods (1) exact, (2) asymptotic, (3) asymptotic with continuity correction
# Required Parameters:
#      n.vector = a vector of the sample sizes that we want to explore
#      p.vector= a vector of probabilities that we want to explore
#      seed = the seed to start the random number generator
#Optional Parameters:
#      nsims=the number of simulations to conduct - default is 1000
#Libraries: Requires the installation of binom package
#Output: Returns an array with the coverage probabilites.  Each matrix within the array
#represents a given sample size in n.vector.  The rows in the matrix are the probabilities we
#want to explore and the columns represent the 3 methods.
#Example: Calculate the coverage probabilities for two sample sizes and 5 proportions

# Function: plot.coverage
# Author: Matthew Smith
# Creation Date: November 28, 2018
# Purpose: This function uses the coverage function from class to calculate coverage probabilities
#          using exact, asymptotic, and asymptotic with continuity correction methods, for up to
#          6 different sample sizes. The function then plots (for each sample size) the coverage
#          probability for each real probability, for each method of determining the coverage probability,
#          all in one plot window.
# Required Parameters:
#      n.vector = a vector of the sample sizes that we want to explore
#      p.vector = a vector of probabilities that we want to explore
#      seed = the seed to start the random number generator
# Optional Parameters:
#      nsims = the number of simulations to conduct (default is 1000)
# Libraries: Requires the installation of binom package
# Dependent Functions: Requires the coverage function from class to be loaded
# Output: This function does not return a value but instead creates plots in the plot window. There is
#         one plot for each sample size given. On each plot, the real probabilities for the underlying
#         simulations are on the x-axis, and the calculated coverage probabilities (using each of the
#         3 methods) are on the y-axis. All of the plots are in the same window, and the size of the
#         legends depend on the number of plots. The function throws an error if the user supplies more
#         than 6 sample sizes.
# Example: In this example, we create plots for sample sizes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60, probabilities
#          ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 by 0.01, and seed 1998.
